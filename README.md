# FossID Workbench API Examples!
These scripts were built by the FossID Customer Experience teams to solve specific use cases raised by customers.

## Example Scripts
The repo contains the following scripts:

### Archive Old Scans
This script helps clients archive stale scans based on when they were last modified.

### Post Scan Gates
This script checks scans for Pending Identifications and Policy Violations - useful for gating CI/CD pipelines.

### Post Scan Reports
This script downloads reports for a scan - useful if you want to include FossID reports with your build artifacts.

## Disclaimers
These examples demonstrate how to interact with the Workbench API. We do our best to keep the examples updated, but there is no long-term maintainer for this code.

We do not use GitHub Issues for this repo - for questions or issues with these scripts please ask through the [FossID Support Portal](https://support.fossid.com/).

Contributions are welcome! We'll review any Pull Requests made.
